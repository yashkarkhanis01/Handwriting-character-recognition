## 📖 Overview

The Handwriting Character Recognition System is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to upload handwritten text images and convert them into digital text. The system leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to recognize and extract text from images. It also includes features for text translation and text-to-speech.
